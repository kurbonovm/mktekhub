  ## 1. BACKEND CI JOB (Spring Boot - Runs in Parallel)
  ## ----------------------------------------------------
  backend-ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # --- SETUP ---
      - name: ☕ Set up JDK 17

        run: mvn spotless:check
        working-directory: ./mktekhub-backend

      # --- BUILD, TEST & COVERAGE ---
      # Runs build, unit tests, integration tests, and Jacoco coverage checks
      - name: ✅ Build and Test Spring Boot Backend
        # We use 'package' to build, run tests, and generate Jacoco report
        # -Dspring.profiles.active=test ensures the tests use the H2 database setup
        run: mvn -B package -Dspring.profiles.active=test
        working-directory: ./mktekhub-backend

      # --- ARTIFACT UPLOAD (For a later CD step) ---

        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: spring-boot-app

          cache: "npm"
          cache-dependency-path: ./mktekhub-frontend/package-lock.json

      # --- QUALITY CHECKS ---

        with:
          name: react-build-dist

  ## ----------------------------------------------------
  ## 3. BACKEND COVERAGE REPORT (Depends on backend-ci)
  ## ----------------------------------------------------
  backend-coverage-report:
    # This job must wait for backend-ci to complete successfully and generate the report artifact
    needs: [backend-ci] 
    # Only run this step on pull requests, as pushing to main is less important for coverage checks

      contents: read
      statuses: write

        with:
          name: backend-coverage-xml
          path: target/site/jacoco # Download to a predictable path

      # --- REPORTING ---
      # This action processes the Jacoco XML file and posts coverage status to the PR.
